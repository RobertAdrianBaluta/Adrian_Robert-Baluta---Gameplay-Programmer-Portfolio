    In this project, I showcase a variety of simple geometric forms to demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of procedural mesh generation. Additionally, I feature a procedurally generated terrain, highlighting the ability to create expansive, varied landscapes that adapt in real-time to different parameters.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>     
      <p>This was mostly a learning experience for me, what started as yet again another school assignment became a big interest to me and I took it as a challenge to learn more about this type of programming.<p>

    <h1>Scripting</h1>
    <p>
      I used C# to create a variety of geometric forms, including cubes, spheres, and pyramids, by defining their vertices and triangles. The procedural terrain was generated using Perlin noise to create realistic height variations, allowing for the creation of hills, valleys, and plateaus. This project not only demonstrates the power of procedural generation but also serves as a foundation for more complex applications such as game development and simulations.
    </p>
    <p>Originally, I had interpolated the vQuadRight (the cross-product between vQuadUp and vQuadNormal). This method proved to be inconsistent because interpolating this vector alone might not result in a dynamic change in the overall size or shape of the cube. So instead, I interpolate the vertex positions themselves.</p>
    <p>The vQuadNormal serves as a key component in determining the positions of the vertices, allowing it to influence the geometry of the cube. By leveraging the vQuadNormal, I can use it as a basis for modifying the cube's size dynamically.</p>

    <p>To prove my point even more, I can make the procedural mesh creation more interesting and dynamic. I can modify how the vertices are generated by adding some variation in the Lerp interpolation function. To give some examples of Lerp manipulation: sinusoidal, Perlin Noise for Randomness, twisting and rotating or other mathematical functions to give the cube a more fun and dynamic effect. I can even change the way we Lerp using easing functions such as SmoothStep, OutBounce, EaseOutElastic, etc. And here is what all of that combined looks like:</p>

      <div class= "scriptleft">
    <p>To further explore procedural mesh generation, I plan to experiment with more complex shapes and dynamic modifications. This includes creating meshes that can morph in real-time based on user input or environmental factors, as well as integrating physics-based interactions to make the meshes respond to forces and collisions. Additionally, I want to delve into optimizing the performance of procedural generation for larger and more detailed meshes, which is crucial for applications in game development and simulations. Here is a pyramid made from the base code of the cube just for fun and I gave it a nice effect too:</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>What I Learned

Interpolation functions have personality.
Linear feels mechanical. SmoothStep feels natural. Elastic and bounce functions feel playful and exaggerated.

Small math tweaks at the vertex level can completely change the feel of a shape.

Quaternions aren’t just theory — they’re incredibly useful when you want controlled twisting without breaking your mesh.

Procedural systems become powerful when you design rules instead of hardcoding results.</p>
