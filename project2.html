    This project was an exciting challenge where I developed the movement, camera, and interaction systems for a first-person game using Unreal Engine C++ for the first time.
    This system contributed to the award-winning gameplay experience of the project.

      <p>My focus was on:</p>
      <p>1. Creating fluid and responsive player movement.​</p>
      <p>2. Implementing intuitive camera controls with adjustable sensitivity</p>
      <p>3. Designing a robust input system using the Enhanced Input API</p>
      <p>4. Ensuring smooth gameplay through efficient character control logic.</p>

        <h1>Building a Flexible Movement System</h1>   
        <p>To support the game's stealth mechanics, I designed a versatile      player controller from scratch that could be easily fine-tuned by designers. Using open variables and adjustable parameters,                         I ensured that movement could be tweaked to fit evolving        gameplay needs.</p>
        <p>I implemented:<p>
        <p>Walking – For normal-speed exploration.</p>
        <p>Sprinting – To escape dangerous situations quickly.</p>
        <p>Crouching – To move quietly and navigate under obstacles.</p>

      <h1>Overcoming Challenges with Unreal Engine</h1>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was adapting to Unreal Engine while working on the project. Coming from a Unity background, I was used to focusing primarily on writing code, letting the engine handle the rest. However, in Unreal, I had to engage more directly with the engine itself—working with components, function calls, references, and editor settings.</p>
      <p>For example, there were times when my code was technically correct, but something still wasn’t working. I would spend hours debugging, only for a designer to check a single box in the editor that instantly solved the issue. These moments were both frustrating and eye-opening, teaching me how crucial it is to understand the interplay between code and engine settings.</p>
      <h1>The Power of Teamwork</h1>
      <p>This challenge also became one of the most rewarding aspects of the project. Since many of the designers had more experience in Unreal but primarily worked with Blueprints, we constantly collaborated to bridge the gap between code and visual scripting.</p>
      <div class ="UETeam">
      <p> I learned from the designers how to better utilize Unreal’s engine features.</p>
      <p>They learned from me how to optimize and extend functionality through C++.</p>
      <p>We worked together, filling in each other's weaknesses to create a polished final product.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Even though it was sometimes stressful, I found the collaborative problem-solving process incredibly fun. Working with a team where everyone had different strengths as well as weaknesses made me appreciate the importance of communication, adaptability, and knowledge-sharing in game development.Ultimately, this experience reinforced how vital teamwork is in the industry, and it became my favorite part of working on the project.</p>
